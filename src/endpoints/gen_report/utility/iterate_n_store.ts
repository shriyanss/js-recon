 * Iterate over a list of URLs and store them in a nested object structure.
 *
 * For each URL, the function will:
 *  - Ignore URLs that start with "mailto:" or "tel:"
 *  - Resolve relative URLs against the given base URL
 *  - Parse the URL and extract the origin and pathname
 *  - Create a nested object structure with the origin as the top-level key
 *  - Create a nested object structure with the pathname as the key
 *  - Ensure that every origin has a root path ("/") inserted
 *
 * The resulting object structure will have the following shape:
 *  - { origin: { /path/to/resource: {}, ... } }
 *
 * @param {string} baseUrl - The base URL to resolve relative URLs against
 * @param {string[]} urls - The list of URLs to iterate over
 * @returns {Promise<object>} - A promise that resolves to the nested object structure
