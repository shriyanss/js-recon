# `src/refactor` — deobfuscation / readability pass

## Purpose

Optional pass that rewrites minified chunks into a more readable form for human review. Not wired into the `run` pipeline — invoked manually after `lazyload` when a contributor wants to inspect specific chunks during resolver development.

## Files

- `index.ts` — entrypoint. Dispatches by tech (`next`, `react-webpack`). Also contains `loadRemoteLibSigs()`, which fetches and intersects `collisions.json` files from the HuggingFace dataset by default.
- `remote/hf-client.ts` — all HuggingFace bucket interaction isolated in one place. Contains `TECH_TO_BRANCH` mapping, URL builders, `fetchText()`, `listCollisionsFiles()`, `fetchCollisionsJson()`, `validateRemoteBranch()`, `getSampleSize()`, `getTechnology()`.
- `remote/config.ts` — reads/writes `~/.js-recon/refactor/config.json` (currently only `maxCacheSizeMb`, default 512 MB). Creates the config dir and a default config if missing.
- `remote/cache.ts` — manages two cache layers: (1) the file list cache (`~/.js-recon/refactor/cs-mast-s-list-cache.json`, refreshed every 7 days or on `--refresh-cache`); (2) per-file signature cache (`~/.js-recon/refactor/signature_cache/<branch>/<subpath>/collisions.json` + `cached_at.txt`). Eviction runs whenever a new file is saved and the cache dir exceeds `maxCacheSizeMb` — oldest entries are deleted until the dir is below 50% of the limit.
- `next/index.ts` — Next.js refactor implementation. Walks the AST, normalizes identifier names where possible, runs Prettier on the output, writes to a sibling directory in `output/`.
- `react/index.ts` — React refactor implementation. Detects each webpack module function under `var e = { <numericId>: function(module, exports, require) { ... } }` (and 2-param re-export modules `function(module, exports) { module.exports = require(N) }`), rewrites `require(<n>)` to `require("./<n>.js")`, captures exports via `Object.defineProperty(<exports>, ...)`, `<require>.d(<exports>, { ... })`, and `<exports>.<minProp> = <X>.<canonical>` assignments. Classifies modules by content fingerprint (`react` via `<X>.current.<hook>(...)` call shape; `react/jsx-runtime` via exports of both `jsx` and `jsxs`; `react-dom/client` via export of `createRoot`); resolves re-export chains. Rewrites bundled user-code callsites documented in `refactor_observations/00-bundled-shape-shared.md`:
    - `(0, <reactLocal>.<hook>)(args)` → `<hook>(args)` + `import { <hook> } from "react";`
    - `(0, <jsxLocal>.jsx)(args)` → `jsx(args)` + `import { jsx, jsxs, Fragment } from "react/jsx-runtime";`
    - `<reactDomLocal>.<minProp>(args)` → `createRoot(args)` using the module's export map.
      Any unrecognised `(0, X.Y)(args)` is still flattened to `X.Y(args)`. Outputs the import lines at the top of the chunk file.
    - In addition to the per-module numeric files, all IIFE body statements that are NOT part of the module map (helpers, app component functions, the `ReactDOM.render(…)` entrypoint) are collected, transformed, and written to `index.js`.
    - The webpack require helper function (detected by its `return (moduleMap[id](...), mod.exports)` return shape) is stripped from `index.js`.
    - Top-level `var x = requireFn(N)` calls in `index.js` are hoisted to `import * as x from "./N.js"`; any remaining inline `requireFn(N)` calls inside nested functions are replaced with the imported identifier.
    - **Pass 4.5**: webpack async chunk loading `requireParam.e(N).then(requireParam.bind(requireParam, N))` is converted to `import('./N.js')` (applied in `transformModule` before stripping the wrapper, only when `requireParam` is known).
    - **`renameRouteComponents`**: after Pass D resolves `lazy` as a bare identifier, this pass traverses the JSX `<Routes>` tree, accumulates path segments, and renames minified lazy-component variables to descriptive PascalCase names (e.g. `/admin/users` → `AdminUsers`). The Suspense fallback becomes `Loading`, the root App function becomes `App`.

## Patterns / gotchas

- **Per-tech subdirs.** Each tech keeps its own AST pass under `<tech>/`; do NOT merge them. Webpack module wrappers are shared in shape, but each framework adds extras (Next.js runtime helpers, React refresh runtime, …).
- **Prettier is required.** Without formatting, the AST-normalized output is harder to read than the original minified code. Don't make Prettier optional.
- **Output goes to a sibling dir** (e.g. `output/<host>/static/js-refactored/`) — never overwrite the source chunks, downstream steps (`map`, `analyze`) still need them.
- **Lossy.** Identifier renaming can produce collisions; the exports walk can collapse multi-getter shapes; refactored code is for human inspection only, never feed it back into `map`.
- **Duplicate default export guard.** Webpack 5 / Vite bundles parsed with `sourceType: "unambiguous"` may already contain `export { X as default }` or `export default X` as real ESM statements in the source. The trailing-export logic in `react/index.ts` checks `codeHasDefaultExport` (a regex over the generated code) before appending another `export default`; omitting this check causes a `SyntaxError: Only one default export allowed per module` from Prettier.

## How to test changes here

```bash
npx tsc && node build/index.js refactor -m output/<host>/mapped.json -t <next|react-webpack> -o /tmp/refactored
```

Spot-check the refactored output by hand.

## `--collisions <file>` (library module stripping)

Library module stripping now has **two sources** for signatures, checked in priority order:

1. **`--collisions <local-path>`** (explicit override) — unchanged from before; accepts a file, standard directory, or per-feature results directory. See the three cases in `buildLibSigs()`.
2. **Remote HuggingFace bucket** (default) — when `--collisions` is absent and `--no-remote` is not set, `loadRemoteLibSigs()` in `index.ts` fetches `collisions.json` files from `https://huggingface.co/buckets/shriyanss/cs-mast-s-dataset` on the bucket prefix mapped by `TECH_TO_BRANCH` (e.g. `react-webpack` → `react/webpack/small`). Files are cached locally under `~/.js-recon/refactor/signature_cache/`.

The refactor command also accepts the legacy `--collisions <file>` argument. When provided, it points at a CS-MAST `collisions.json` file produced by `cs-mast --all-scat-permutations` over a cross-app baseline (the `js-recon-research` 18-React-feature experiment). Modules whose body signature is in the baseline set are treated as library code and skipped during refactor.

**Pipeline in this directory:**

1. `index.ts` accepts a file path, a standard baseline-tree directory, or a per-feature results directory for `--collisions`. `buildLibSigs()` handles three cases and returns `{ sigs: Set<string>; desc: string } | null` directly (the caller no longer loads the file itself):
    - **Case 1 — direct file path**: reads the file, keeps records whose `count` equals the maximum count, and returns that `Set<string>`.
    - **Case 2 — standard directory**: walks the four directory candidates in order (`<dir>/baselines/<tech>/<scat>/collisions.json`, `<dir>/<tech>/<scat>/collisions.json`, `<dir>/<scat>/collisions.json`, `<dir>/collisions.json`) until a file is found, then applies the max-count filter. The `<scat>` segment comes from `BASELINE_SCAT_DIR[tech]` — keep that map in sync with each tech's `LIB_SIG_SCAT` constant.
    - **Case 3 — per-feature results directory**: detects `<dir>/<feature>/<scat>/collisions.json` by scanning immediate subdirectories, then **intersects** the max-count signature sets across all feature subdirs. Only one file per feature subdir is read (e.g. 18 files for 18 features). A signature that survives intersection appears in every feature's max-count set and is definitionally library code.

    The resulting `Set<string>` of library signatures is passed down to `refactorReact()` / `refactorNext()` as the `libSigs` argument.

2. `react/index.ts`'s `moduleIsLibrary()` re-hashes each module's body with `cs_mast_init({ scat: ["lit","decl","loop","cond"] })` and looks every sub-tree signature up in `libSigs`. If any matches, the module is dropped.
3. The default `lit-decl-loop-cond` scat config matches the directory name used in the research experiment's output tree (`feature-signatures/<feature>/lit-decl-loop-cond/collisions.json`). Changing the scat list here means consumers must change which `collisions.json` they pass.

See `react/CLAUDE.md` for the full build history and signature-matching rationale. The user-facing docs are at `js-recon-docs/docs/docs/modules/refactor/react-webpack.md` under "Library module stripping (with `--collisions`)".
