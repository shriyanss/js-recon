 * Uses GET rather than HEAD: makeRequest's response cache is keyed on URL only (not
 * method), so a cached HEAD response would poison the later GET that downloads the
 * body — every other crawler in this codebase uses GET for the same reason.
 *
 * `concurrency` (default 1, matching every other generic-tech call site's default
 * single-threaded behavior) controls how many candidates are in flight at once — a
 * worker-pool over the candidate list, same shape as generic_downloadFiles.ts's
 * `processOne`/`worker` pattern. Internal#75: a webpack chunk-hash-map can list far
 * more candidates than a string-literal scan ever would (every chunk ID an entry
 * chunk knows about, not just ones referenced by a literal path), and each failing
 * candidate costs up to `10 retries * requestTimeout` in makeRequest — sequential
 * confirmation of a large candidate batch, with even a handful of dead chunk IDs in
 * it, becomes prohibitively slow. Passing a caller-supplied `threads` value here
 * (already threaded through generic tech for downloads) keeps that path proportional.
