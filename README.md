A powerful tool for JavaScript reconnaissance. `js-recon` helps you discover, download, and analyze JavaScript files to uncover endpoints, secrets, and other valuable information from any web application running supported frameworks.

It can also reconstruct HTTP requests that the app makes to the server, and output them to the OpenAPI spec.

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS and Linux)

```bash
brew tap js-recon/tap
brew install js-recon
```

This always installs the latest **stable** release. For the latest alpha or beta prerelease instead:

```bash
brew install js-recon/tap/js-recon-alpha
brew install js-recon/tap/js-recon-beta
```

To update:

```bash
brew update && brew upgrade js-recon
```

> **Note:** If you installed JS Recon before the move to the `js-recon` GitHub organization, you may still have the old `shriyanss/tap` tapped locally. Since that repo was renamed (not deleted), Homebrew still resolves it, leaving two taps that both serve a formula named `js-recon` — causing errors like `Formulae found in multiple taps` or `Refusing to load formula ... from untrusted tap ...`. Fix with `brew untap shriyanss/tap` before installing from `js-recon/tap`.

> **Note:** After installing via Homebrew, the `lazyload` subcommand requires a Chromium browser. Run `brew info js-recon` for setup instructions.

### npm (all platforms)

This tool requires Node.JS and `npm` to be installed. The [official download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download) can be referred. Please install **22.17.0 (LTS)** or later. Downloading older versions might break the tool.

To install the tool globally, run:

```bash
npm i -g @js-recon/js-recon
```

For detailed installation and setup process, please refer to the [Installation page](https://js-recon.io/docs/docs/installation)

## Framework Support

The features in JS Recon tool are built after thorough research on apps running different frameworks.

Full pipeline support (lazyload → map → analyze → report) is available for: **Next.js**, **Vue.js**, **Nuxt.js**, **React**, **Svelte/Astro**, and **Angular** (v17+ / esbuild).

Please refer to the [Framework Support](https://js-recon.io/docs/docs/framework-support) page for detailed information on feature compatibility across different frameworks.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Get a list of all commands
js-recon --help

# Get help for a specific command
js-recon <command> --help
```

To launch a quick assesment against a target, the `run` module can be used to automate other modules

```bash
js-recon run -u https://app.example.com
```

## Key Features

- Downloads all dynamically loaded JS files (refered as `lazyload`) from website with supported frameworks
- Use API gateway to rotate IP addresses to bypass firewall
- Extract strings from the discovered JS files, and extract potential secrets, endpoints, etc. from them (built-in scanner via `--secrets`; TruffleHog integration via `--trufflehog`)
- Endpoints modules extracts client-side paths from the app
- Map feature analyzes the JS files and outputs it to a JSON file. An interactive mode can be then used to analyze it
- Reconstruct HTTP requests that the app makes to the server, and output them to the OpenAPI spec
- Run analyze to find potential issues in JS code and the HTTP requests the app makes
- Generate a report from the analyze module

## Example Scenario
